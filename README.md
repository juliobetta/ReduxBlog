* *Container* is a *React Component* that has a direct connection to the state managed by *Redux*
* A *reducer* is called when an *action* occurs
* *Middlewares* are functions that take an *action*, and, depending on the action type, payload or any other factors, decide if let it pass, manipulate it, log it or stop it.
